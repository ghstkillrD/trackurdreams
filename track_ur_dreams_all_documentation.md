# Track ur Dreams

## Project Description
A webapp tracks your dreams and give insights using AI. We'll use Gemini AI to give insights. The app should be stylized and somewhat dreamy.

There should be a landing page describing the product along with a text box for users to submit their first dream. This will sign up the user and submit their dream. The user will have a dashboard page that displays all of their recordings. If they click on a recording, they should be taken to another page that contains their recording and meta information as well as the AI insight.

For the free tier users will be able to record as many dreams as they wish, but they'll only get 5 free insights. There will just be one subscription that allows them unlimited AI insights for $5/month.

## 2. Relationships

The following relationships define how the different entities interact:

*   **One-to-Many (`users` to `dreams`):** Each user can record multiple dreams. The `dreams.user_id` column references `users.id`.
*   **One-to-One (`dreams` to `ai_insights`):** Each dream can have at most one AI insight associated with it. The `ai_insights.dream_id` column references `dreams.id` with a `UNIQUE` constraint.
*   **One-to-One (`users` to `user_subscriptions`):** Each user has one active subscription record. The `user_subscriptions.user_id` column references `users.id` with a `UNIQUE` constraint.
*   **Many-to-One (`user_subscriptions` to `products`):** Many user subscriptions can be associated with a single product definition (e.g., many users subscribe to the 'premium_monthly' product). The `user_subscriptions.product_id` column references `products.id`.

## 3. Indexing and Constraints

To ensure optimal performance and data integrity:

*   **Primary Keys:** All `id` columns will be indexed automatically as primary keys.
*   **Foreign Keys:** Foreign key constraints (`FOREIGN KEY`) will be established to maintain referential integrity between tables.
*   **Unique Constraints:** `users.email`, `user_subscriptions.user_id`, and `ai_insights.dream_id` will have unique indexes to prevent duplicate entries.
*   **Check Constraints:** `dreams.sleep_quality` will have a check constraint to ensure values are within the valid range of 1 to 5.
*   **Default Values:** Appropriate default values (e.g., `NOW()` for timestamps, `FALSE` for boolean flags) will be set to simplify data entry and maintain consistency.

## 4. Data Access and Security Considerations

*   **Row-Level Security (RLS):** Supabase's RLS will be extensively utilized to ensure that users can only access their own dream data and subscription details. This is paramount for privacy.
*   **Encryption:** All data stored in the database will be encrypted at rest by Supabase. Data in transit will be secured via HTTPS/TLS, handled by Vercel and Supabase.
*   **Sensitive Data:** Dream text and AI insights are considered highly sensitive. Access policies will be strictly enforced to prevent unauthorized viewing or leakage.
*   **AI Data Usage:** The schema includes fields (`gemini_api_request_payload`, `gemini_api_response_raw`) to optionally log API interactions for auditing and debugging, but the project ensures that user dream data is NOT used to train Google's general AI models, aligning with privacy commitments.

*   **Typography**: Headlines use a rounded, soft sans-serif font for a friendly and gentle feel. Body text, especially for dream narratives and AI insights, uses a very clean, highly legible font to ensure comfort in reading.
*   **Imagery & Textures**: Backgrounds frequently utilize soft gradients that smoothly blend colors. Subtle cloud-like textures or soft light effects are layered to enhance the dreamlike quality. Sharp edges and harsh shadows are strictly avoided.
*   **Animations & Transitions**: All interactions are designed to feel fluid and gentle. Buttons will have subtle glows or slow pulses on hover. Page transitions will employ soft fades or gentle slides. Elements like modals will gracefully appear and disappear, avoiding abrupt changes. Small, abstract, amorphous shapes will slowly float in the background of key pages (like the landing and dashboard) to maintain the surreal atmosphere.
*   **Responsiveness**: The entire UI will be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes while maintaining its aesthetic integrity.
*   **Privacy & Transparency**: Wherever sensitive data is handled (e.g., account deletion, AI processing), brief, clear on-screen messages or links to the comprehensive Privacy Policy will reinforce user control and data privacy.

## Styling Guidelines
STYLING GUIDELINES

**1. Introduction**
The "Track ur Dreams" web application aims to provide a serene, intuitive, and visually enchanting experience that aligns with the mystical and introspective nature of dreams. Our styling principles are centered around creating a "dreamlike" atmosphere ‚Äì soft, gentle, magical, and a little surreal ‚Äì making users feel as though they are interacting with a cloud or a cherished memory.

**2. Design Principles (UI/UX)**
*   **Dreamy & Serene:** Evoke a sense of calm, wonder, and introspection. The aesthetic should be soothing, encouraging users to relax and explore their subconscious. Avoid anything jarring or visually noisy.
*   **Intuitive & Effortless:** The user experience should be seamless and straightforward, minimizing cognitive load. Especially for dream entry, the process must be quick and simple to capture fleeting memories.
*   **Personal & Reflective:** The design should support individual exploration and self-improvement, presenting insights in an accessible and non-overwhelming manner, consistent with the AI acting as a helpful guide.
*   **Consistent & Cohesive:** Maintain a unified visual language across all pages and components to build trust and familiarity.
*   **Accessible:** Ensure high readability, sufficient color contrast, and clear interactive elements for a broad user base (adults 18-50+, and potentially younger/older users interested in self-improvement and mindfulness).

**3. Color Palette**
Our color palette uses soft, hazy hues reminiscent of dawn, dusk, and the ethereal quality of dreams, accented with shimmering elements.

*   **Primary Hues (Backgrounds, Main Text, Soft Elements):**
    *   **Lavender Mist:** #D8BFD8 (Soft, calming purple for backgrounds and subtle accents)
    *   **Misty Blue:** #B0C4DE (Gentle, introspective blue for backgrounds and secondary elements)
    *   **Soft Pink:** #FFDAB9 (Warm, delicate peach/pink for gradients and subtle highlights)
    *   **Warm Gray:** #F0F0F0 (Neutral, grounding, off-white for main content backgrounds and card fills)

*   **Accent Hues (Buttons, Highlights, Interactive Elements, CTA):**
    *   **Shimmering Gold:** #FFD700 (Adds a touch of magic, premium feel, and draws attention to primary calls-to-action like "Upgrade to Unlimited" or "Submit Dream")
    *   **Soft Mint Green:** #98FB98 (Fresh, subtle highlight for positive feedback, success messages, or secondary interactive elements)

*   **Text Colors:** A soft charcoal (#333333) or dark variations of the primary hues will be used for body text to ensure readability against light backgrounds, while accent colors can be used for highlighted text.

**4. Typography**
Typography is chosen for its friendliness, readability, and ability to convey a soft, modern aesthetic.

*   **Headlines (H1, H2, H3):**
    *   **Font Family:** Montserrat (or similar rounded, modern sans-serif like "Quicksand" or "Inter SemiBold").
    *   **Characteristics:** Friendly, gentle, and easily legible. Used for page titles, section headings, and dream titles.
    *   **Usage:**
        *   H1: Landing Page Title ("Track ur Dreams"), Dashboard Main Title ("Your Dreams")
        *   H2: Section Headings (e.g., "AI Insight", "Record a New Dream")
        *   H3: Sub-headings (e.g., "Date", "Mood", "Tags", "Your AI Insight")

*   **Body Text (Paragraphs, Form Inputs, Labels):**
    *   **Font Family:** Inter (or similar clean, highly readable sans-serif like "Roboto" or "Open Sans").
    *   **Characteristics:** Very clean, easy-to-read, ensuring dream stories and AI insights are presented without visual fatigue.
    *   **Usage:** All paragraph text, full dream descriptions, AI insights, form input text, and small descriptive labels.

*   **Accessibility:** Ensure sufficient font sizes and line heights for comfortable reading. Text colors will always have a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 against their background, adhering to WCAG guidelines.

**5. Imagery, Textures, & Visual Elements**
Visuals will reinforce the dreamlike, ethereal quality of the application.

*   **Gradients:** Soft, multi-color gradients are central to the aesthetic. These will blend primary hues (e.g., Misty Blue seamlessly transitioning into Lavender Mist or Soft Pink) and be used extensively for backgrounds of pages, cards, and hero sections.
*   **Backgrounds:** Instead of flat colors, backgrounds will feature very subtle cloud-like textures, soft light effects, or gentle, blurred patterns that evoke a sense of depth and atmosphere. These should be non-distracting and serene.
*   **Shapes & Illustrations:** Organic, abstract shapes (soft blobs, wispy forms, stylized stars, moon phases) will be used as decorative elements, particularly on the landing page and empty states. Avoid sharp edges or geometric rigidity.
*   **Borders & Shadows:** Elements like cards, buttons, and input fields will feature rounded corners. Shadows will be soft, diffused, and subtle, giving a sense of gentle elevation rather than harsh depth, rather than sharp, hard lines.
*   **Icons:** Simple, minimalist line-art or softly filled icons that align with the overall gentle aesthetic. For "Mood" selection, clear and expressive emojis are preferred for quick input.

**6. Interactions & Animations**
Animations will be subtle, smooth, and reinforce the feeling of magic and gentleness, rather than being abrupt or jarring.

*   **Hover States:** Interactive elements (buttons, links, clickable cards) will exhibit a gentle glow, a subtle pulse, or a soft, almost imperceptible shift in color when hovered over. This provides clear feedback without being aggressive.
*   **Transitions:** Page transitions and component appearances/disappearances will use smooth fade-ins/outs or gentle, short-duration slide animations (e.g., a card sliding into view) to maintain fluidity and a premium feel.
*   **Form Submissions:** Upon submitting a dream (e.g., on the landing page or dashboard), the input area or a confirmation message might gently fade away like mist, offering a visual cue of successful submission and integration into the user's dream log.
*   **Ambient Animations:** The landing page and dashboard might feature small, abstract shapes (like stars or soft blobs) that float slowly and continuously in the background, adding to the ethereal atmosphere without distracting from the main content.

**7. Component Styling Guidelines**
Specific styling for common UI components, aligning with the "shadcn" approach for modularity and consistency.

*   **Buttons (Primary/Secondary):** Rounded corners (e.g., `rounded-full` or `rounded-lg`), soft gradient backgrounds using primary hues, or solid colors from the accent palette (Shimmering Gold for primary CTAs). Gentle hover glow. Text color will ensure high contrast.
*   **Input Fields:** Soft, subtle borders (e.g., `border-gray-300`). Focus states will use a gentle glow or a thin, accent-colored border (e.g., `ring-2 ring-lavender-mist`). Placeholder text will be in a lighter shade of the body text color. The large text area for dream entry will clearly expand and be inviting.
*   **Cards/Containers:** Used for displaying individual dreams or sections (e.g., AI insight). Rounded corners, subtle background fills (often soft gradients or lighter primary hues), and diffused `shadow-md` or `shadow-lg` to lift them slightly from the background.
*   **Navigation:** Minimalist and clear. Active links might be indicated by a soft underline or a subtle background highlight in an accent color. Dropdowns will maintain rounded corners and soft styling.
*   **Modals/Pop-ups:** Semi-transparent overlay backgrounds (e.g., `bg-black/50`). The modal itself will have rounded corners, soft background, and appear with a gentle fade-in animation. This is critical for the subscription upgrade prompt ("You've used your 5 free insights!").
*   **Notifications & Alerts:** Non-intrusive, appearing with a soft fade, using accent colors (e.g., Soft Mint Green for success, a soft red for errors) and clear, concise messaging.

**8. Tone & Voice (UI Copy)**
The language used in the UI should align with the dreamy and reflective aesthetic, making the user feel understood and guided.

*   **Friendly & Supportive:** The AI acts as a "helpful guide," and the language throughout should be encouraging, empathetic, and non-judgmental. Avoid clinical or overly technical terms.
*   **Intriguing & Reflective:** Encourage users to ponder their dreams and insights. Use words that evoke wonder and personal discovery.
*   **Simple & Clear:** Especially for Calls to Action (CTAs) and error messages, ensure clarity and directness without being overly formal or verbose.

This styling guide ensures that "Track ur Dreams" provides a consistent, beautiful, and emotionally resonant experience for its users, reflecting the magic and mystery of the dream world.
